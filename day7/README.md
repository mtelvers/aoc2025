# Day 7 - Laboratories

Starting from `S`, beam down through the map, splitting at each `^`.

I read the diagram as a map of `(x,y)` coordinates, but in retrospect, a list of arrays may have been a more optimal choice.

## Part 1

In this part, calculate how many times we reach an `^`. This is a breadth-first search tracking the number of beams at each iteration. I used a coordinate map to track the beams at each level which helpfully automatically absorbs duplicate beams.

## Part 2

This time, follow each possible path and count how many ways there are to get to the end. This is a depth-first search where the trivial algorithm works on the test dataset, but with the actual input, the number of possibilities is too large. Therefore, I added a hashtbl to memoise the results at each level. With this, all 25 trillion ways are counted in a matter of a few milliseconds.
